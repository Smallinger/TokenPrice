# TokenPrice
TokenPrice DataBroker module in World of Warcraft.

## Description
TokenPrice is a very simple addon that adds a data broker module to display the current price of WoW tokens and recorded price changes. It also converts the current gold price to real money currency per 1000g if you wish to purchase tokens to sell.

Supported currencies: US Dollar, Euro, British Pound, New Taiwan Dollar, Chinese Yuan and South Korean Won. Currency can be chosen from the options menu (accessible via right click).

To freely place the DataBroker module anywhere check out my DataBroker display addon [Candy](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/candy).

## Dependencies
TokenPrice uses Ace3, LibRealmInfo and LibDataBroker which are included in the /libs directory.
